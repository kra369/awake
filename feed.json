You’ve got things to do. And when you’ve got those things already set out in front you, you’re more likely to take action on them than if you started with blank canvas every morning.</p>\n<h3><figure class=\"alignnone wp-image-10055\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://3j6x6z2bx1qq1aawwt3b6y0a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/twhy-you-need-goals-rack-progress.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 55px) 100vw, 55px\" srcset=\"https://3j6x6z2bx1qq1aawwt3b6y0a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/twhy-you-need-goals-rack-progress.png 110w, https://3j6x6z2bx1qq1aawwt3b6y0a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/twhy-you-need-goals-rack-progress-100x100.png 100w\" alt=\"why you need goals- track-progress\" width=\"55\" height=\"55\"></figure>Track your progress</h3>\n<p>Want to know how close you are to <a href=\"https://convertkit.com/product-launch-email-sales-funnel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">launching your next product</a> or starting your blog? Setting goals helps you track your progress on the road to success.</p>\n<p>Not only will this tracking give you a feeling of accomplishment looking back on all your hard work, tracking your goals can also help you establish a system for the next time you take on a similar big goal. That means the next time you want to<a href=\"https://convertkit.com/webinar-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> create a new webinar</a>, you can pull up your goals from the last webinar you created and simply change out the content.

It’s like all my hard work has paid off, and I know it’s time to reward myself.</p>\n<p>Every little win like this is important when you’ve got big dreams for your future. Having goals set out that you can accomplish will be just the motivation you need to move on to the next goal, and then the next, and then the next.</p>\n<p>You’d be surprised how far you can get on pure motivation.</p>\n<h3><figure class=\"alignnone wp-image-10057\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://3j6x6z2bx1qq1aawwt3b6y0a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/why-you-need-goals-mindful-future.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 55px) 100vw, 55px\" srcset=\"https://3j6x6z2bx1qq1aawwt3b6y0a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/why-you-need-goals-mindful-future.png 110w, https://3j6x6z2bx1qq1aawwt3b6y0a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/why-you-need-goals-mindful-future-100x100.png 100w\" alt=\"why you need goals- mindful-future\" width=\"55\" height=\"55\"></figure>Mindful of the future</h3>\n<p>Finally, goals keep you forward focused. If you’re thinking about the next thing you want to take on and how to make that happen, you’ll always be making progress. As a creator, that’s incredibly important.</p>\n<p>The moment you stop dreaming is the moment you stop creating, and you can’t make a living when you’re stuck in that cycle.</p>\n<p>Setting goals for yourself keeps your mind spinning and your imagination running with possibilities.</p>\n<h2>How to set the right goals</h2>\n<p>But it’s not just about arbitrarily throwing spaghetti against the wall to see what sticks. It’s good to keep that imagination running, but you need a plan to go along with it all.</p>\n<p>Goals for goals sake will get you nowhere fast. You need to set the right kinds of goals. Here are a few tips to setting the right kind of goals.</p>\n<h3><figure class=\"alignnone wp-image-10049\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://3j6x6z2bx1qq1aawwt3b6y0a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/how-to-set-the-right-goals-measurable.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 55px) 100vw, 55px\" srcset=\"https://3j6x6z2bx1qq1aawwt3b6y0a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/how-to-set-the-right-goals-measurable.png 110w, https://3j6x6z2bx1qq1aawwt3b6y0a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/how-to-set-the-right-goals-measurable-100x100.png 100w\" alt=\"how to set the right goals- measurable\" width=\"55\" height=\"55\"></figure>Goals need to be measurable</h3>\n<p>If you can’t measure your goals, how do you know if you’re making progress?</p>\n<p>Making measureable goals is as easy as creating small steps along the way to reach your one big goals. Or if your goal is monetary, setting up milestones to reach that help you know if you’re still on pace to hit your target.</p>\n<h3><figure class=\"alignnone wp-image-10050\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://3j6x6z2bx1qq1aawwt3b6y0a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/how-to-set-the-right-goals-realistic.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 55px) 100vw, 55px\" srcset=\"https://3j6x6z2bx1qq1aawwt3b6y0a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/how-to-set-the-right-goals-realistic.png 110w, https://3j6x6z2bx1qq1aawwt3b6y0a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/how-to-set-the-right-goals-realistic-100x100.png 100w\" alt=\"how to set the right goals- realistic\" width=\"55\" height=\"55\"></figure>Goals need to be realistic</h3>\n<p>Yes, you need to push yourself. But there is a sweet spot between setting goals that challenge your skills and pitting yourself against unbeatable odds.</p>\n<p>It might take some time to figure out where your fine line is, and that’s totally ok! Think of it as an early lesson in failures and carrying on.</p>\n<p>So when you’re setting your goals, set some realistic goals. Ones that you can meet and even surpass as first. Get that motivation rolling and sense of accomplishment on lock and then start thinking of bigger stretch goals that really test your limits.</p>\n<h3><figure class=\"alignnone wp-image-10051\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://3j6x6z2bx1qq1aawwt3b6y0a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/how-to-set-the-right-goals-long-short.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 55px) 100vw, 55px\" srcset=\"https://3j6x6z2bx1qq1aawwt3b6y0a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/how-to-set-the-right-goals-long-short.png 110w, https://3j6x6z2bx1qq1aawwt3b6y0a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/how-to-set-the-right-goals-long-short-100x100.png 100w\" alt=\"how to set the right goals- long-short\" width=\"55\" height=\"55\"></figure>Goals need to be both long- and short-term</h3>\n<p>It might be easier to just set long-term goals. They seem far enough away, but you might get a false sense of security. You’ll think, “I’ve got all the time in the world. I’ll get around to it.”</p>\n<p>Yeah, that’s never going to work.</p>\n<p>Have that long-term goal–there’s no harm in it, but also set short-term goals that keep you accountable to yourself. Setting and accomplishing those short-term goals will also create that beautiful confidence and motivation to keep pursuing your long-term goals.</p>\n<h3><figure class=\"alignnone wp-image-10052\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://3j6x6z2bx1qq1aawwt3b6y0a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/how-to-set-the-right-goals-written.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 55px) 100vw, 55px\" srcset=\"https://3j6x6z2bx1qq1aawwt3b6y0a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/how-to-set-the-right-goals-written.png 110w, https://3j6x6z2bx1qq1aawwt3b6y0a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/how-to-set-the-right-goals-written-100x100.png 100w\" alt=\"how to set the right goals- written\" width=\"55\" height=\"55\"></figure>Goals need to be written down</h3>\n<p>Dr. Gail Matthews, a psychology professor at the Dominican University in California, studied the art and science of goal setting and found that <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/marymorrissey/the-power-of-writing-down_b_12002348.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you become 42% more likely to achieve your goals and dreams, simply by writing them down on a regular basis</a>.</p>\n<p>When you write something down, it’s like you’ve given life to those words.

And it’s the same with goals.</p>\n<p>The simple act of writing down your goals gives them more significance and weight.
